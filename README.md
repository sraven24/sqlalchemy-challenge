# SQLALCHEMY - CHALLENGE
With this challenge, I am analyzing weather data from various weather stations in Hawaii.  Various aspects of the climate are examined such as precipitation amounts, rain frequency, and atmospheric temperature.  The first half of the project is through Jupyter notebook and utilizes sqalchemy to interact with a sqlite databasewhile the second half uses a python file to open an instance of flask to display the results.

# Installation
The program in Jupyter notebook should run so long as you have matplotlib and pandas installed.  You will need to install flask in to properly run the python app (named app.py).

# Resources and documentation
All information for this project was sourced from the activities of module 10.
